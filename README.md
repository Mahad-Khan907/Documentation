Summary of the Development Process:

On Day 1, I focused on the initial planning and setup of the marketplace project. This included setting up the project repository, organizing the project structure, and installing necessary tools and dependencies. I defined the core features, designed the database schema, and structured the development environment for smooth development and future testing. The key task was ensuring a solid foundation that would support the subsequent stages of the project.

Day 2 was dedicated to designing and implementing the user interface (UI). I worked on creating the product listing, details page, and cart system. My main goal was to design an intuitive, user-friendly interface. During this phase, I integrated the functionality to add products to the cart and display product details, ensuring a smooth user experience.

On Day 3, I focused on integrating the backend with APIs, which included connecting the frontend with the backend to fetch product data and other necessary details. I integrated Sanity CMS to manage content and handle user data. Testing was an essential part of this day to ensure the APIs returned accurate data and the website displayed it correctly.

Day 4 was all about implementing advanced features such as user authentication, setting up a secure checkout process, and ensuring secure transactions. I also worked on improving the site's security, ensuring sensitive user data was properly handled. Additionally, I focused on error handling to guarantee a seamless user experience even in case of unexpected issues.

On Day 5, I concentrated on testing and refining the website’s functionality. I ran various functional and performance tests using tools like Lighthouse, validated API responses using Postman, and ensured the website's usability across different devices. I implemented error handling mechanisms for edge cases and optimized the site's performance for faster load times. Finally, I documented all the test cases and created reports to track the website’s progress.

Finally, on Day 6, I prepared for deployment by setting up a staging environment. I selected a hosting platform (Vercel or Netlify), configured environment variables securely, and deployed the application to a staging server. I ran functional, performance, and security tests again in the staging environment to verify everything worked as expected. I also updated the documentation and organized the project files in a GitHub repository. With all tasks completed, the marketplace was ready for production deployment.

In summary, the development process involved planning, design, implementation, testing, and preparation for deployment. Each day contributed to building a fully functional, secure, and optimized marketplace ready for production
